"""LPI (Land and Property Identifier) transformation stage.

==============================================================================
CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW: The "Official" Local Authority View of an Address
==============================================================================

This script constructs address strings based on data provided by Local
Authorities (City & County Councils), rather than Royal Mail.

To a non-expert, it might seem strange that "Official" addresses are separate
from "Postal" addresses, but they serve different purposes. Local Authorities
are legally responsible for naming streets and numbering buildings (for taxes,
voting, emergency services, and planning). Royal Mail is responsible for
delivering post. While usually the same, these two views often diverge
(e.g., a "Granny Annexe" might be a separate property for Council Tax, but share
a letterbox with the main house for Royal Mail).

This script assembles the Local Authority view.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where does the data come from?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We combine three specific tables from AddressBase Premium:

1.  **LPI (Land and Property Identifier - Record Type 24):**
    This is the core "linking" table. It doesn't contain the street name itself.
    Instead, it links a physical object (UPRN) to a street (USRN) and adds the
    specific house numbers or names.
    *   *Provenance:* Local Authority Custodians.

2.  **Street Descriptor (Record Type 15):**
    This table holds the actual text names of streets (e.g., "High Street").
    We join this to the LPI using the USRN (Unique Street Reference Number).
    *   *Provenance:* Local Authority Custodians.

3.  **BLPU (Basic Land and Property Unit - Record Type 21):**
    This represents the physical existence of the property (the coordinate point).
    Crucially, it usually holds the Postcode (supplied by Royal Mail but linked
    to the council record).
    *   *Provenance:* Local Authority (geometry) + Royal Mail (postcode link).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How is an address constructed? (The "Lego Brick" approach)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AddressBase is "normalized," meaning the address isn't stored as a full line
of text. It is stored as components (SAO and PAO) that this script glues together.

*   **SAO (Secondary Addressable Object):** The "inner" part of an address.
    e.g., "Flat 3" or "First Floor".
*   **PAO (Primary Addressable Object):** The "outer" part of an address.
    e.g., "12" or "The Manor House".

The logic in `build_base_address` combines these:
    [SAO Start] [SAO Suffix] [SAO Text]  ->  "Flat 1"
             +
    [PAO Start] [PAO Suffix] [PAO Text]  ->  "12 Example House"
             +
    [Street Descriptor]                  ->  "Main Street"
             +
    [Town] + [Postcode]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why does this script generate multiple rows per property?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A single property (UPRN) can have multiple LPI records. This is valuable for
matching messy user input. We output variants based on **Logical Status**:

1.  **Approved (1):** The current, legal address.
2.  **Alternative (3):** A valid alias (e.g., a house has a number "4" but is
    locally known as "Rose Cottage").
3.  **Provisional (6):** The address assigned during planning/construction, which
    might change before the house is built.
4.  **Historic (8):** An old address. If "10 High St" is renumbered to "12 High St",
    the old address is kept as Historic. This helps match old datasets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Columns Explained
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   `uprn`: The "Golden Key". Use this to link this address to other data.
*   `base_address`: The constructed full address string.
*   `logical_status`: 1=Current, 6=Provisional, 8=Historic.
*   `official_flag`: 'Y' indicates this is the "official" version, 'N' suggests
    it might be an unofficial alias.
*   `language`: 'ENG' (English) or 'CYM' (Welsh). Streets in Wales often have
    two records, one in each language. We process both.
