CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW: Classifications & "Floor Level" Variants
==============================================================================

This script handles two distinct but useful tasks:
1.  Identifying **what** a property is (Classification).
2.  Creating extra address variants based on which **floor** a property is on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: Classification ("Is it a house or a shop?")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An address tells you *where* a building is. A classification tells you *what*
it is.

*   **Source:** Classification Table (Record Type 32).
*   **Provenance:** Local Authorities and Ordnance Survey surveyors.
*   **The Code:** `prepare_classification_best`
*   **Concept:**
    Every UPRN has a classification code (e.g., "RD" for Residential Dwelling,
    "C" for Commercial). However, a single property might have multiple
    classification records from different schemes (legacy vs. modern).
    This function picks the "winner" for each UPRN, prioritizing the modern
    "AddressBase Premium Classification Scheme". This allows downstream users to
    easily filter for "just houses" or "just businesses".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Custom Level Variants ("First Floor Flat")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To a non-expert, if you live on the first floor, you might write your address as
"First Floor Flat, 10 High Street". However, the official Council address might
simply be "Flat A, 10 High Street".

If the official data tracks the vertical position of the property (the Level),
we can generate a variant to match the human-written address.

*   **Source:** LPI Table (Record Type 24) -> `level` column.
*   **Provenance:** Local Authority Custodians.
*   **The Code:** `render_custom_levels`
*   **Concept:**
    The LPI record often contains a numeric `level` (e.g., "1", "2", "0").
    This script translates those numbers into words and sticks them onto the
    front of the address.

    *   **Mapping:**
        *   -1 -> "BASEMENT"
        *   0  -> "GROUND"
        *   1  -> "FIRST"
        *   (up to 6 -> "SIXTH")

    *   **Example:**
        *   Official Address: "Flat A, 10 High Street"
        *   LPI Level Data: "1"
        *   **Generated Variant:** "FIRST Flat A, 10 High Street"

    This is purely a synthetic address variant designed to catch user input where
    the floor level is written out explicitly.
